      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</string>

2. LICENSE GRANT. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
consideration for the representations, warranties, and covenants made by
Customer in this Agreement, Stream.io grants to Customer, during the term of
this Agreement, a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
license to:

a. install and use Software Source Code on password protected computers at a Site,
restricted to Authorized Users;

b. create derivative works, improvements (whether or not patentable), extensions
and other modifications to the Software Source Code (“Modifications”) to build
unique scalable newsfeeds, activity streams, and in-app messaging via Stream’s
application program interface (“API”);

c. compile the Software Source Code to create Executable Object Code versions of
the Software Source Code and Modifications to build such newsfeeds, activity
streams, and in-app messaging via the API;

d. install, execute and use such Executable Object Code versions solely for
Customer’s internal business use (including development of websites through
which data generated by Stream services will be streamed (“Apps”));

e. use and distribute such Executable Object Code as part of Customer’s Apps; and

f. make electronic copies of the Software and Modifications as required for backup
or archival purposes.

3. RESTRICTIONS. Customer is responsible for all activities that occur in

sublicense or transfer the Software or any Source Code related to the Software
or any of Customer’s rights under this Agreement, except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, (b) use the Software Source Code for the benefit of a third
party or to operate a service; (c) allow any third party to access or use the
Software Source Code; (d) sublicense or distribute the Software Source Code or
any Modifications in Source Code or other derivative works based on any part of
the Software Source Code; (e) use the Software in any manner that competes with
Stream.io or its business; or (e) otherwise use the Software in any manner that
exceeds the scope of use permitted in this Agreement. Customer shall use the
Software in compliance with any accompanying documentation any laws applicable
to Customer.

4. OPEN SOURCE. Customer and its Authorized Users shall not use any software or
software components that are open source in conjunction with the Software
Source Code or any Modifications in Source Code or in any way that could

Customer may permit its employees, contractors, and agencies of Customer to
become Authorized Users to exercise the rights to the Software granted to
Customer in accordance with this Agreement solely on behalf of Customer to
provide services to Customer; provided that Customer shall be liable for the
acts and omissions of all Authorized Users to the extent any of such acts or
omissions, if performed by Customer, would constitute a breach of, or otherwise
give rise to liability to Customer under, this Agreement. Customer shall not
and shall not permit any Authorized User to use the Software except as
expressly permitted in this Agreement.

6. COMPETITIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. Customer shall not use the Software in any way
to engage in the development of products or services which could be reasonably
construed to provide a complete or partial functional or commercial alternative
to Stream.io’s products or services (a “Competitive Product”). Customer shall
ensure that there is no direct or indirect use of, or sharing of, Software
source code, or other information based upon or derived from the Software to
develop such products or services. Without derogating from the generality of
the foregoing, development of Competitive Products shall include having direct
or indirect access to, supervising, consulting or assisting in the development
of, or producing any specifications, documentation, object code or source code
for, all or part of a Competitive Product.

Customer will not assert against Stream.io, its affiliates, or their customers,
direct or indirect, agents and contractors, in any way, any patent rights that

affiliates’, or their customers’, direct or indirect, agents’ and contractors’
manufacture, use, import, offer for sale or sale of any Stream.io products or
services.

automatically terminate if Customer is or becomes a competitor of Stream.io or
makes or sells any Competitive Products. Upon termination of this Agreement for
any reason, (a) all rights granted to Customer in this Agreement immediately
cease to exist, (b) Customer must promptly discontinue all use of the Software
and return to Stream.io or destroy all copies of the Software in Customer’s
possession or control. Any continued use of the Software by Customer or attempt
by Customer to exercise any rights under this Agreement after this Agreement
has terminated shall be considered copyright infringement and subject Customer
to applicable remedies for copyright infringement. Sections 2, 5, 6, 8 and 9
shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason.

11. OWNERSHIP. As between the parties, the Software and all worldwide intellectual
property rights and proprietary rights relating thereto or embodied therein,
are the exclusive property of Stream.io and its suppliers. Stream.io and its
suppliers reserve all rights in and to the Software not expressly granted to
Customer in this Agreement, and no other licenses or rights are granted by
implication, estoppel or otherwise.

12. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER. USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT YOURS AND CUSTOMER’S
OWN RISK. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
WHATSOEVER. STREAM.IO DOES NOT MAKE, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ANY WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, RESULTS, EFFORTS,
QUALITY OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. STREAM.IO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS
ERROR-FREE, WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, WILL MEET ANY SPECIFIC NEED
THAT CUSTOMER HAS, THAT ALL DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED OR THAT IT IS
SUFFICIENTLY DOCUMENTED TO BE USABLE BY CUSTOMER. TO THE EXTENT THAT STREAM.IO
MAY NOT DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND
DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW.
CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS RELIED ON NO WARRANTIES OTHER THAN THE
EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT.

13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, STREAM.IO’S
TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR
THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE,
SHALL NOT EXCEED $100. IN NO EVENT WILL STREAM.IO BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING ANY LOST DATA AND LOST PROFITS, ARISING FROM OR RELATING
TO THE SOFTWARE EVEN IF STREAM.IO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS PROVISION REFLECTS THE AGREED UPON
ALLOCATION OF RISK FOR THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT STREAM.IO WOULD NOT ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON ITS LIABILITY.

14. General. Customer may not assign or transfer this Agreement, by operation of
law or otherwise, or any of its rights under this Agreement (including the
license rights granted to Customer) to any third party without Stream.io’s
prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Stream.io may assign this Agreement, without consent, including, but
limited to, affiliate or any successor to all or substantially all its business
or assets to which this Agreement relates, whether by merger, sale of assets,
sale of stock, reorganization or otherwise. Any attempted assignment or
transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Stream.io shall
not be liable hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of
its obligations hereunder for any cause which is beyond the reasonable control.
All notices, consents, and approvals under this Agreement must be delivered in
writing by courier, by electronic mail, or by certified or registered mail,
(postage prepaid and return receipt requested) to the other party at the
address set forth in the customer agreement between Stream.io and Customer and
will be effective upon receipt or when delivery is refused. This Agreement will
be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
Colorado, without reference to its choice of laws rules. The United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to
this Agreement. Any action or proceeding arising from or relating to this
Agreement shall be brought in a federal or state court in Denver, Colorado, and
each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court
in any such action or proceeding. All waivers must be in writing. Any waiver or
failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be
deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other
occasion. If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, such provision
will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision
to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining
provisions will continue in full force and effect. Customer shall not violate
any applicable law, rule or regulation, including those regarding the export of
technical data. The headings of Sections of this Agreement are for convenience
and are not to be used in interpreting this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” This
Agreement (including all exhibits and attachments) constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties regarding the subject hereof and supersedes all
prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings and communication, whether
written or oral. This Agreement may be amended only by a written document
signed by both parties. The terms of any purchase order or similar document
submitted by Customer to Stream.io will have no effect.
